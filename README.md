MACROSCODE
Software Engineer and Maker in Germany

Hi there, I’m known as MacrosCode. I’m a software engineer from Germany.

I am a fan of Pocket PC, Windows Mobile, C# and the .NET Compact Framework.
Take a look at my app Notepad Mobile Reloaded for Windows Mobile.

I’m also interested in making things with the Arduino.
